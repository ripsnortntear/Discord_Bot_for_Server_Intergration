# Security Policy for dbsi Discord Bot

## Overview

The `dbsi` Discord bot is designed to facilitate SSH commands and server management tasks. Given its capabilities, it is crucial to ensure that security best practices are followed to protect both the bot and the servers it manages.

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables
- **Sensitive Information**: Store sensitive information such as `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `SERVER_ADDR`, `SSH_PASSWORD`, `SSH_PORT`, `SSH_USER`, and `SUDO_COMMAND_PASSWORD` in a `.env` file. Ensure this file is not included in version control (add it to `.gitignore`).
- **Access Control**: Limit access to the environment variables to only those who need it.

### 2. Discord Permissions
- **Role Management**: Assign appropriate roles to users who can interact with the bot. Only grant permissions necessary for the bot's functionality.
- **Command Restrictions**: Ensure that commands that can affect server state (e.g., `!restart`, `!shutdown`) are restricted to users with administrative permissions.

### 3. SSH Security
- **Use SSH Keys**: Prefer SSH key authentication over password authentication for connecting to the SSH server. If passwords must be used, ensure they are strong and regularly updated.
- **Limit SSH Access**: Restrict SSH access to specific IP addresses if possible. Use firewall rules to limit exposure.

### 4. Input Validation
- **Command Injection Prevention**: Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent command injection attacks. Ensure that only expected commands are executed.
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information through error messages.

### 5. Logging and Monitoring
- **Log Activity**: Implement logging for bot commands and SSH connections. Monitor logs for any suspicious activity.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for unusual activities, such as repeated failed login attempts or unauthorized command executions.

### 6. Regular Updates
- **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies to their latest versions to mitigate vulnerabilities. Use tools like `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities.
- **Bot Code**: Review and update the bot code periodically to incorporate security improvements and best practices.
